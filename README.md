I am excited to share a web application project that I developed using modern web technologies such as JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. This project was built as part of "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023" course on Udemy, where I gained hands-on experience in developing dynamic web applications and learned best practices for building scalable applications.

The project demonstrates my proficiency in creating RESTful APIs, handling user authentication and authorization, and implementing CRUD functionality. I used the EJS templating engine to generate dynamic HTML pages and integrated a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data.

The responsive user interface was designed using Bootstrap, providing a seamless user experience on different devices. The project also showcases my ability to work with various technologies and integrate them into a fully functional web application.
